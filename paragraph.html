It has been more than 5000 years now since the Lord Krishnaâ€™s existence. Yet, even today people worship him with utter reverence and take his name with so much of adoration in their heart. Why? He had sixteen thousand queens and He lived a royal and luxurious worldly life. Yet, He is worshipped as God.

<p>
Lord Krishna is worthy of worship and that is why He is respected. One should not respect anyone who is not worthy of worship. Lord Krishna should be worshipped with respectful understanding and not just for the sake of worshipping.
